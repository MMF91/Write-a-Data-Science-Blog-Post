# Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post

### Description
This project is part of Udaicty Data Science Nanodegree. The aim of the project is create a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of my own.

For this project, I was interestested in using No-show Appointment data sets to investigate into further to answer the following questions:

- What’s the distribution of appointments during the week: weekday vs weekend?
- What’s the distribution of no-show appointments during the week: weekday vs weekend?
- Do patients with scholarship tend to no-show more than patients with no scholarship?
- Do female patients tend to no-show more than male patients?
- Do patients diagnosed with Alcoholism, or Hipertension tend to no-show more than patients that are not?

### Files:
- noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv: no-show appointment data.

- Write a Data Science Blog Post.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that showcase work related to the above questions.

### Results:
The main findings of the code can be found at [Who will not show up for their appointment?](https://medium.com/@mawadamf91/who-will-not-show-up-for-their-appointment-c203b6aa9796) post.
