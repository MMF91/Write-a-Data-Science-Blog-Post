# Write-a-Data-Science-Blog-Post

### Description
This project is part of Udaicty Data Science Nanodegree. The aim of the project is create a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of my own.

For this project, I was interestested in using No-show Appointment data sets to investigate into further to answer the following questions:

- What's the distribution of appointments durring the week: weekday vs weekend?
- What's the distribution of no-show appointments durring the week: weekday vs weekend?
- Does patients with scholarship tend to no-show more than patients with no scholarship?
- Does female patients tend to no-show more than male patients?
- Does patients diagnosed with Alcoholism, or Hipertension tend to no-show more than patients that are not?

### Files:
- noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv: no-show appointment data.

- Write a Data Science Blog Post.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that showcase work related to the above questions.

### Results:
- Appointments are schduled at the begging of the week more than rest of the week. There is barely any appointments in the weekend.Â¶
- No-show rate is almost the same on all the days: 79%
- Patients with no scholarship tend to not show to the appointment by 88%
- Female patients tend to not show to the appointment by 65%
- Patients who are not diagnosed with Alcoholism, or Hipertension tend to not show to the appointment by 82%
